# TotalQuestXP

Track the amount of XP you're set to gain at turn-in.

This is an addon for **World of Warcraft Classic** (set to release on August 27. 2019).

### NOTICE: Make sure the folder is named "TotalQuestXP" when installing the addon.

Features
* This addon adds a status bar that summarizes your total experience quest reward, from all currently completable quests in your quest log.
* The bar keeps track of your current and required experience and will show you when you have saved up enough experience to go back to your quest hub to ding.
* (optional) Quest that require you to “speak with” some NPC are included as completed.
* (optional) Quests that are not yet completed are shown on the bar with green fill/texture.
* Options panel allows for slight configuration.

Hopefully, the addon lets you decide whether or not you need to a grind a few extra mobs before returning to town, to avoid running back and forth.
